By outsourcing web app development, you can reduce project costs, improve
product quality, and shorten the time to market. These are just some of the
reasons why companies are turning to external talent to handle their IT
projects. But outsourcing is as much about the journey as it is about the
destination. There’s a lot more to think about than the price-quality ratio. To
get the best return on investment, you need to establish a thorough screening
process and look towards a long-term collaboration that doesn’t end the moment
a project is marked complete.

Here are some of the most important considerations for developing a successful
outsourcing relationship:

#1. Finalize your business goals
--------------------------------

As digital transformation becomes a key business driver in today’s
technology-focused world, companies are placing great importance on innovation.
But innovation is more than just a goal. It’s a complex set of evolving needs
based on current market conditions and existing business systems and processes.
A widespread lack of alignment between technological solutions and business
needs is one of the main reasons most digital transformations [achieve disappointing results](https://ceoworld.biz/2019/03/30/most-digital-transformations-fail-heres-how-to-change-that/).

When it comes to web app development, it’s crucial that you have a clear
picture of what you want to achieve. There must be a clear business need for it
in the first place. Before you start looking for an outsourcing partner, you
should have a finalized concept. This should include a general description of
your web product and a list of objectives associated with it, such as business
goals and technology requirements. Software development and project management
teams often summarize these factors in the form of a user story, which outlines
the who, what, and why of the project. Here’s an example: ‘As a customer, I
want a shopping cart that allows me to save items I can come back to later.’
This will allow you to develop a list of questions to ask in the screening
process and establish a realistic budget.

#2. Find the right team
-----------------------

In many circles, outsourcing is still considered as a way of doing things on
the cheap with little regard to quality and support. While that can certainly
be the case if you choose your partners based on their prices alone,
outsourcing can help you overcome talent shortages by allowing you to tap into
the best knowledge and experience in the sector. However, finding the right
outsourcing partner is perhaps the hardest step of all. That’s why, before you
start scouring the freelance websites, developer blogs, and B2B directories,
you should make a shortlist of your requirements.

One of the most important decisions is whether to outsource locally, nearshore,
or offshore. Offshore is the most popular outsourcing model where price is the
biggest concern, but it can also result in communications delays due to working
across multiple time zones and reduced project oversight. Outsourcing locally,
while undoubtedly the more expensive option, provides the benefit of complete
oversight and easier communications. A local company will also have a better
view of your target market and business needs compared to one the other side of
the world. Nearshoring often presents itself as a compromise between the two.

#3. Select the best service model
---------------------------------

When you’re outsourcing app development, it’s critical you choose the right
service model. All too often do businesses make the mistake of outsourcing a
project only to achieve the bare minimum and end up with an app fraught with
bugs and other issues. This is a common issue with outsourcing offshore or
hiring freelancers on the cheap through the bidding platforms. In many such
cases, there’s a complete lack of post-project support, which also means you
have to find a place to host your app and manage all the maintenance and
upgrades yourself.

</blockquote>

Many service models are project-based, which means there’s a predefined goal
that the team needs to reach within a specified timeframe. This is ideal for
companies which have their own IT departments and are able to organize app
hosting and maintenance themselves. But if you don’t have your own team, you’ll
be better off choosing a dedicated outsourced partner which provides full-cycle
development and post-project support. This gives businesses more control over
the process, making it ideal for those with very specific needs, such as
integrating existing business systems or adding complex functions which need
extensive testing.

You’ll also need to choose a suitable payment model. While the costs vary
widely depending on whether you’re outsourcing locally or offshore and which
service model you choose, you’ll need to maintain complete visibility into
ongoing costs. Fixed-price contracts are ideal for those with limited budgets
and where the scope of work is clear, but it can also be a major capital
expense. The pay-as-you-go model, which is popular among agile software
developers, offers much greater flexibility, making it ideal for more complex
projects which need ongoing support or are hard to determine the scope of in
advance.

#4. Establish efficient communications
--------------------------------------

The most important component of any outsourcing relationship is also one many
businesses get wrong – communication. By now, most of us are familiar with the
barrage of complaints so many employees in IT have when trying to deal with a
disparate team of developers around the world, none of whom who are able to
work effectively as a team. Communications issues abound in such cases due to
factors like different time zones, lack of local expertise, and a lack of
familiarity with security and privacy regulations like the CCPA. While
communications tools like Slack and WhatsApp can go a long way towards
simplifying the process, relying on them entirely can result in serious
inefficiencies.

The ability to provide quick feedback is essential
</blockquote>

It’s important that you choose the right collaboration tools and establish
communication needs from the outset. The ability to provide feedback is
essential when it comes to developing web projects. If there’s something you
don’t like about the direction of the project, it’s important the outsourced
partner knows about it immediately. Especially in the early stages of the
project, it’s strongly advisable that you hold daily meetings to ensure it gets
started on the right track. Every project should start with a planning meeting
that defines the scope of the work before meeting up at regular intervals
thereafter to synchronize progress. Once each milestone has been reached, there
should be a meeting to showcase the result and provide feedback.
